## What is Threat Mirror

Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity threat intelligence for SMEs and developing economies through an open-source platform. Leveraging free threat feed providers as a starting point, our goal is to empower organizations to assess their cyber health, detect potential threats, and bolster their digital immunity. Our commitment to open-source principles ensures accessibility and affordability, enabling even resource-constrained entities to benefit from threat intelligence. By fostering collaboration and community-driven innovation, we will strive to build a sustainable ecosystem where cybersecurity expertise is shared and amplified for the collective defense of all.
Therefore, this project aims to technically review the existing open-source threat intelligence platform with an aim to find features and gaps specific to the needs of SMEs and developing economies. In an ever-evolving landscape of digital risks, we aim to provide a robust platform powered by open-source tools to aggregate, process, and convert diverse threat feeds into meaningful intelligence thus enabling organizations that cannot afford commercial Threat intelligence platforms to gain visibility before they are exploited and mitigate risk. The long-term vision of the project is to build threat intelligence platform with capabilities to analyze and visualize data from external threat feeds and internal malware analysis data. The ability to integrate the solution into existing security solutions in place including SIEM/XDR, Incident response ticketing system, vulnerability management and malware information sharing platforms will be a long term priority.
