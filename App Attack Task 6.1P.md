# App Attack 

## Overview, Goals and Objectives

The goal of AppAttack is to provide a thorough security analysis of
ThotTech's OnTrack Project, a web application that instructors and
students use for formal assessment in coursework-based topics. To find
vulnerabilities and improve the project's overall security posture, the
focus will be on doing a secure code review and penetration test. The
goal of AppAttack is to provide a thorough security analysis of
ThotTech's OnTrack Project, a web application that instructors and
students use for formal assessment in coursework-based topics. To find
vulnerabilities and improve the project's overall security posture, the
focus will be on doing a secure code review and penetration test.

All team members participating in the testing may access a secure,
sandboxed OnTrack environment that AppAttack has set up and housed
within a Kali Linux virtual machine. A forked copy of the code is used
to build this sandboxed instance, ensuring a controlled testing
environment while protecting the privacy of the live system. To
thoroughly examine OnTrack for flaws in its security posture, code
errors, and vulnerabilities, testers will assume the viewpoint of
external attackers. We employ both automatic and manual attack
techniques to thoroughly evaluate OnTrack's security. After the
assessment is finished, AppAttack will provide ThotTech with a thorough
security report that lists all vulnerabilities found and suggests fixes.

This study will improve the security status of the OnTrack application
by providing guidelines for properly hardening the application and its
underlying code. AppAttack hopes to provide ThotTech with useful
insights to strengthen the security of the OnTrack Project with this
thorough security evaluation.

## Aim for the Trimester

Establishing a fruitful partnership with ThotTech's Ontrack Project is
the main goal of AppAttack, with an emphasis on carrying out a
comprehensive security assessment of their web application. AppAttack
simultaneously looks at potential joint ventures with other Capstone
firms. AppAttack hopes to create a collaborative atmosphere through this
effort where our experience in secure code review and penetration
testing can be used to different projects, providing a synergistic
effect. By working together, we hope to maximise the effectiveness of
our security evaluations and promote the sharing of knowledge.

## Trimester Deliverables

- Pentest and SCR Finding and Remediation Report: A thorough report
  including the findings from secure code reviews and penetration tests,
  as well as suggested corrective actions.

- Sandboxed testing environment hosting: To enable safe testing and
  experimentation, a sandboxed testing environment may be established
  inside a virtual machine.

- Planning and Reporting for Incident Response: creating an incident
  response strategy and offering a thorough report on how it was carried
  out.

- Strengthen Security standing: set measures in place to strengthen the
  security position of the organization.

## Long-Term Deliverables

- Collaboration Establishments with other capstone projects: Forming
  partnerships with additional capstone projects to encourage the
  exchange of knowledge and promote synergy.

- Research and build upon AppAttack Future vision: Conducting research
  and refining the long-term vision for the advancement and prosperity
  of AppAttack.

- Update upskilling resources and testing methodologies: Regularly
  updating resources for skills enhancement and testing techniques to
  ensure they are up to date.

- Establish a safe security culture amongst team members: Cultivating a
  secure culture within the team by fostering awareness and
  accountability for cybersecurity.

To meet our objectives for this trimester and provide the groundwork for
AppAttack's ongoing development and success, these deliverables are
crucial.

## Project Mid-trimester Progress

### Penetration Testing Team Progress:

The Penetration Testing Team, comprising 17 members with two team and
one junior team co-lead, has made significant strides in the security
assessment and penetration testing of the OnTrack Project. Team members
working together has improved our productivity in producing outcomes.
The team overcame early difficulties with participation using peer
mentoring and workshops. To show the potential consequences of these
vulnerabilities, the team successfully exploited them. We have found,
verified, examined, and resolved seven distinct vulnerabilities thus
far.

The validation of the remaining vulnerabilities is being worked on, and
follow-up measures have been started for any discoveries that need to be
adjusted before the report is published. This is a respectable number of
findings, especially considering the difficulties encountered and
overcome. These will be combined into a report that will be sent to our
clients in the meantime. The goal of our team is to continue this path
by developing vulnerabilities that have been found and broadening their
reach through continuous penetration testing.

### Secure Code Review Team Progress:

The Secure Code Review Team, comprising 13 members with two team and one
junior team co-lead, has made significant strides in the security
assessment and secure code review of the OnTrack Project. Working as a
team has increased our productivity and produced better results. To
demonstrate the potential ramifications of these vulnerabilities, the
team successfully exploited them. So far, we have identified, validated,
evaluated, and resolved twenty unique vulnerabilities.  
Validation of the remaining vulnerabilities is underway, and follow-up
steps have been initiated for any discoveries that require adjustment
before the report is published. This is an astounding number of
discoveries, especially given the time and team members spent on the
review. In the interim, we will put these into a report and send it to
our clients. Our team's mission is to continue this path by developing
discovered vulnerabilities and increasing their reach through continuous
code review.

## Project Plan Updates

### Leadership Team

1.  Collaborate with other capstone companies to create a
    multi-application testing environment. This will enable projects in
    future trimesters to test multiple applications simultaneously,
    allowing for more student participation and leadership opportunities
    for juniors.

2.  Initiate partnership with Innovations Team to procure a server space
    to be able to deploy application on servers to simulate the
    possibility of network-based attacks and simulate real world
    scenarios for vulnerability testing along with the sandboxed virtual
    machine environment.

3.  Hosting regular knowledge-sharing sessions and meetings, to foster
    cross-functional synergy wherever feasible.

### Penetration Testing Team:

1.  Provide comprehensive penetration testing findings in mid- and
    final-trimester reports, including handover reports that detail
    detected vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended
    remediation measures.

2.  Going forward, the project plan calls for the addition of further
    workshops aimed at enhancing team members' skill sets. These
    workshops are considered essential to the ongoing process of
    developing capacity and improving skills.

### Secure Code Review Team:

1.  Members receive hands-on training and workshop sessions to increase
    their understanding of secure coding practices and methodologies.

2.  Curating and maintaining a collection of secure coding principles
    and best practices for members to follow.

3.  In mid- and final-trimester reports, provide complete penetration
    testing findings, including handover reports that outline
    vulnerabilities discovered, their severity, and suggested
    remediation actions.
